Description: 
	Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libaries.
	Some libraries require compile-time linking.  In conjunction with
	BH, this package aims to provide a useful subset of Boost compiled
	libraries for use among other CRAN packages.  By placing these
	libraries in a single package, we hope to offer more efficient
	distribution of Boost libraries that reduces code-duplication in
	other packages.
